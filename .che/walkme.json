By now, we're very used to seeing <b>beans.xml</b> and <b>faces-config.xml</b> in <b>WEB-INF/</b>(which can be found in the <b>src/main/webapp</b> directory of the example). Notice that, once again, we don’t need a web.xml. There are two configuration files in <b>WEB-INF/classes/META-INF</b> (which can be found in the <b>src/main/resources</b> directory of the example) — <b>persistence.xml</b>, which sets up JPA, and <b>import.sql</b> which Hibernate, the JPA provider in WildFly, will use to load the initial users into the application when the application starts.
